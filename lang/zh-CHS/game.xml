            性能更新!<br>
            感谢 Hordex 在 Discord 的帮助, 我们重新整理了关于显示更新的代码使它更顺滑.<br>
            这意味着选项中的 "每秒更新次数" 将正确的对所有显示生效.<br>
            后期玩家如果觉得卡顿可以降低这个数字 - 这个只会影响显示的更新速度, 并不会导致游戏变慢.<br>
            ---<br>
            额外的, 在 MrPitt 的帮助下我们在所有区域都添加了新的故事, 行动阶段, 和其他更新!

                <q>属性有什么用?</q>
                <a>鼠标悬停在 "属性" 上可以查看. 属性的效果权值取决于你进行的行动.一般来说，更高的属性意味着在循环中完成更多的工作。

                <q>短循环更有利.</q>
                <a>游戏早期短循环显然更有利, 但当你有了足够多的天赋和灵魂石,
                   或许长循环更有效率.

                <q>技能增益 / 减耗如何工作的?</q>
                <a>增益类通常会给予 (1 + 等级 / 60) ^ .25 倍, 因此高等级往往会有一个相当明显的边际衰减.
                减耗类将会使消耗变为 1 / (1 + level / 100) 倍, 因此减耗类并不能让你的消耗归零.

                <q>我什么时候该进行黑暗仪式?</q>
                <a>以大家的反馈来看, 黑暗仪式消耗量少于你灵魂石总量的 5% 是合适的.
                当然, 选择权在你, 而且未来可能会出现一些其他功能导致优先级变化.

            <story num="0"> <!--Beginning of Game-->
                You're a simple courier, on a long trip to deliver a high priority package. Just as you entered town,
                you tripped - breaking your glasses - and the package burst open, spilling a strange liquid on you.
                Immediately, your meager amount of mana started draining rapidly. Right as your mana completely ran out, 
                you found yourself back in the moment the liquid was absorbed into your skin, with your tiny reserves
                filled... yet draining just as before. This happened again and again, the world resetting with you,
                until you decided you had to figure out a way to prolong how long these 'loops' were. Mana crystals are
                often stored in pottery around town, perhaps you'll start there ...
            </story>
            <story num="1"> <!--First Soulstone-->
                您到达了地牢的终点，一个踏板上，悬浮着一个散发着柔和光芒的球体。那就是地牢核心，不过也只是第一层的核心。您抓住了它，它的精华开始涌入您的身体，它的力量逐渐为您所用。它蕴含的能量虽然不多，但毕竟这个地牢也不大。您一定会再回来的，因为获得这些能量时您同时也获得了外来的知识，知道这些能量将永远与您同在。
            </story>
            <story num="2"> <!--No Soulstone-->
                You reach the end of the dungeon again, but for the first time the core isn't glowing. It's always been
                thought that dungeon cores feed upon the mana spent around them, but you're beginning to think the
                essence of its previous incarnations drains it somehow. It doesn't always happen, but you'll need to
                put more mana into the world to reap the core's benefits out of it. You shrug, accepting yet another
                oddity of the loops.
            </story>
			<story num="3"> <!--Change 3 to Forest-->
				After spending most of a loop preparing, you're finally ready to leave Beginnersville. In a way, you're
				going to miss this town, and the thought of leaving almost brings a tear to your eye - until you realize
				you'll just be back next loop. Grumbling, you set off, hiking into the forest. By the time you're
				ready to make camp, you're in a good mood again. The forest is beautiful, teeming with life, and looks
				to have boundless places to explore. Best of all, on your way here, you passed several locations that
				are absolutely saturated with mana - you think you'll check those out first.
		</story>
		    <story num="4"> <!--Merchanton-->
				It's always nice, after doing the same dull tasks over and over, to make your way through the forest and 
                get to do something new. Whether you're exploring, hunting, learning something or just sitting by the 
                waterfall, the forest always makes a great backdrop. However, as pleasant as it's been here, it's time to 
                move on, at least for now. It would be a long trip, but luckily, after all your exploring, you know some 
                shortcuts, and before long, Merchanton emerges out of the trees. There's a lot to do here! Maybe one of 
                the guilds can help you with your looping problem! Or maybe there's a book in the library that can lead you 
                to a solution! Or maybe... or maybe... that all sounds like a lot of work, and you have been going through a

				a pickaxe and start the climb! Reaching Mt. Olympus takes a lot of climbing but along the way, you discover these mana
				geysers which look like they can be harvested with a pickaxe. You also discover runes scattered around the mountain, maybe
				deciphering them might be useful? Finally, about half way up this mountain, you discover a massive cavern with room to take a
				break climbing and explore it. You met these Friendly Trolls in these caverns. Sadly, they don't sell snowcones...
			</story>
			<story num="6"> <!--Good Reputation Story--> <!--Change 6 to Valhalla-->
				You have finally reached the top of Mt. Olympus! There is a giant door at the very top and a voice rings out: "Mortal! You stand
                to be JUDGED by the GODS! Step forth and face JUDGEMENT!" After waiting for what feels like hours, the voice rings out once more: 
                "You may PASS!". You enter the wonderful, otherwoldly home of the gods, Valhalla, where... you spot a tourist guide almost immediately.
                Unexpected as the guide is, having a God show you around turns out to be well worth the money. Several Gods busy themselves with

			<story num="7"> <!--Bad Reputation Story--> <!--Change 7 to Startington-->
                A booming voice rings out as the clouds part overhead, and you instinctively cover your ears as every word makes your bones rattle:
                "YOU HAVE BEEN JUDGED!" The world around you becomes a blur, and it takes a second before you realize you are falling off the side of
                Mt. Olymups. Even as the wind pulls on your skin, you can tell that you're not just falling in a physical sense as the world around
                you is drained of every last bit of colour, the last streak of purple light off in the distance by the time you realize you've stopped
                falling some time ago. Pushing yourself to your feet, you look around and find yourself right in front of a very familiar town-gate.
                The purple light is coming from a massive pillar reaching up from the center of town, casting the only light for miles around in this,
                the Shadow Realm. Oh, and the sign on the gates states this place is called "Startington." Evidently, you're not in any familiar territory
                any more.

			<story num="8"> <!--Change 8 to Jungle Path-->
                Shadow realm or not, there are enough things that haven't changed that you still lean on your established routine. Right down
                to the part where you have to get some supplies to brave the jungle just outside the small town, from a local trader. Too bad
                this one is quite selectively deaf to your attempts at haggling, but hey. You've gotten good enough at budgeting and scrounging
                up coins that you could pay him in the end. Turning your eyes to the narrow trail through the dense jungle before you, you set
                foot among the wild trees, noting the ruins among the tree-trunks. Wonder if this place had always been a jungle...
			</story>
			<story num="9"> <!--Made the Looping Potion--> <!--Change 9 to Looping Potion-->
                Learning the finer points of alchemy, of the subtle rules underpinning the "simple" brewing of potions had been a long, exhausting
                trial, but since you have nothing but time on your hands, you have become an expert by any standard. As you let a bundle of herbs
                soak in a mana geyser, you double-check your notes and prepare your equipment. The brew itself is finnicky but finally, you fill
                a bottle with the fruits of your Great Work. The Loop Potion, the exact same brew that got you into this situation. 
                ...Reflecting for a moment, you wonder if there was much of a point to all of this. Not like making more of the stuff will get you
                out of the loops.
			</story>
			<story num="10"> <!--Change 10 to Commerceville-->
                Exploring the jungle ruins took quite a lot of time, and you just barely manage to make your way to the other side before the imposing
                gate among the trees closes. You mentally take note that you're on a time limit if you want to make it here on future loops, and that
                the pattern of the "normal" world still holds: On the other side of the jungle lies a small-ish city that proudly identifies itself
                as "Commerceville, the heart of trade!" according to the statue along the way to the city gates. While just wandering is liable to get
                you in trouble with some of the townsfolk, there is a helpful tourist guide willing to show you around for a "reasonable" sum. Even if
                the guide looks a little too eager to lead you down the city's many narrow alleyways, you can't deny that learning about the Thieves guild
                was worth the risk to get there. Finally, at the end of the tour, you learn that your guide also works for the tax collectors and really
                can't stay to chat. At least your guide was nice enough to show you to the Bank. There is an imposing hooded figure leaning against a wall
                of the bank, maybe they can tell you something more...

                <![CDATA[
                    You can't help but chuckle as you make your way out of the Bank's "Big Shot" office, keys to the <i>entirety</i> of Commerceville in hand.
                    Sure, the loan wasn't cheap and you'd probably get into a lot of trouble if you'd stick around for the first payment, but there's no way
                    your mana reserves will last that long. Looking ahead, you blink at the first blatant difference between this world and the normal one:
                    There is no Mt. Olympus. Instead, there is a large, wide valley with the ruins of a tower in the middle of it. It takes a bit of Doing,
                    but you eventually find a stone covered in familiar runic script: "Children of the land! We, the seven guardian deities, challenge you!
                    Find us, fight us, and claim the throne of the gods!" ...Oh well, time for a bit of deicide. The "throne of the gods" sounds like just the
                    kind of thing that could break you out of the loops, and they <i>did</i> issue a challenge for anyone to find. Step one will be to reach them.

          意思是其中80法力是 <div class="bold">Int</div>, 另外 80 是 <div class="bold">Soul</div>, 然后剩余的 640 是 <div class="bold">Cha</div>.<br>
          如果你的 <div class="bold">Cha</div> 在行动开始时等级为 20 , 加成就是 x1.2 也就是实际法力消耗为 640 / 1.2 = 533.33<br>
          再加上 <div class="bold">Soul</div> 和 <div class="bold">Int</div> 的 160 法力消耗, 总行动消耗 (向下取整) 应该是 694, 也就是 ~87% 的总消耗.<br>

Having to track down some half-wild survivor and gut them before the jungle does it first is a pain, and it takes you far more time than you like to even find your mark in the first place.

With the headquarters here, there should be plenty of more trusted guild members chomping at the bit to take care of this one. In any case, you opt to blend into the crowd rather than jump across the roofs. Too many eyes looking up in the search for trouble around here.

            <story_8><![CDATA[<b>100% Witch knowledge learned:</b>⮀ Somehow she seems to sense something about you this loop, and she tells you her name, and its the name she gives for every loop after. Trisha. You manage to pry most of her relationship with the hermit from her. They were lovers once, this you knew, but what you didn't was that she was of nobility and he a common vagabond. She fell for him and him for her, it was a love for the ages she tells you while drunk from the wine you brought along with you. He wanted to run away with her and she agreed, too love struck to question why. He was running from deals he had made and bargains he had forsaken, his glib tounge landing him in trouble of the otherworldly nature. Trisha seems frustrated with her youth's naivety as she tells you how she was made a scapegoat for his failings and forfeits in his deals and bargains. How she was essentially sold to the dark gods as his forfeit. When you ask what she did in return, all Trisha does is smile with dark satisfaction, the fire flaring briefly.]]></story_8>

            <story_1><![CDATA[<b>3rd ritual segment reached:</b>⮀ Knowing what the ritual was and how large a space you would need, you were mildly surprised to find a clearing large enough in the forest. Well, the clearing itself wasn't really large enough on its own. It was a dense cluster of clearings that you've taken mana from that you could easily clear out to make a ritual space. Preparing the altar is surprisingly tame, all said and done. Stone and wood comprise most of the altar and the rest you brought with you when you made this plan. In the end the altar you build is only small, a communion point instead of a summoning. Holding a heart from nearby deer, you pierce it and begin to chant ritualistic words of power. The clearing grows dark and the forest quietens, nary a sound is heard apart from the drip drip drip of the blood from the pierced heart in your hand. The blood you've spilled on the altar begins to blacken and swirl without outside force and eventually forms into a small face, disgusting to look at but enough to communicate through.]]></story_1>
            <story_2><![CDATA[<b>Ritual completed:</b>⮀ You commune with the dark gods long past the point that the blood has faded. The deal is struck thusly: time itself will move faster for you only in select areas, and you will pay a cost in souls. The dark god you commune with seems almost surprised as you immediately offer up some of the soulstones that you have.]]></story_2>
            <story_3><![CDATA[<b>50 Rituals completed:</b>⮀ The more rituals you perform, the more extravagant setups the dark gods demand, and the less they reward you with.

            <story_4><![CDATA[<b>300 Rituals completed:</b>⮀ The dark gods have been less and less willing to deal with you as of late, no matter how many soulstones you offer. Is their power stretching near its limits, or have you become so powerful that they're starting to see you as a threat? You're not sure.]]></story_4>
            <story_5><![CDATA[<b>666 Rituals completed:</b>⮀ The face emerges from the blood, but this time its expression is grim. It explains to you how, although your offering will be accepted this time, there can be no more deals made after today. No matter how much you poke or prod, it refuses to elaborate, and when it finally sinks back into the now-dry pool, you're just as baffled by the dark gods' motives as you were this morning.]]></story_5>

			<story_1><![CDATA[<b>1 Chronomancy:</b>⮀ Chronomancy is unlike any other magic you've practiced, and unbelievably finnicky. The mana has to be held perfectly still, as if time is at a standstill, and the slightest mistake will cause the entire spell to destabilize. It's hard work, but you finally get the hang of it and you feel yourself speed up by the barest fraction.]]></story_1>

Unfortunately, though, the mana drain of the loops appears to have kept up as well, so even though you're getting the same amount of work done in less time you can't seem to get more work done in a loop.]]></story_2>

With a snap, the entire length of the wood catches fire all at once, turning into a cozy camp fire. Mundane as such a trick may seem, making fire just from the friction between your fingers is the kind of fire mastery the ancient masters could only dream of! ...Briefly, the idea of an army of women in mini skirts comes to mind, but you push that weird thought to the side.]]></story_4>

            <story_3><![CDATA[<b>Reached "Disciple" rank:</b>⮀ Getting used to watching people go up in flames and then commend you while their clothes are still wet from getting doused still feels weird, but you're definitely moving up. Better yet: you now have a council-appointed mentor! He's quite gruff and seemingly impossible to please, but trying to meet his heavens-high standards has taught you much in and of itself.]]></story_3>
            <story_4><![CDATA[<b>Reached "Magician" rank:</b>⮀ The test takers still regularly go up in flames, but by now they've stopped assigning you to a mentor. Instead, you have shown enough skill and mastery to be awarded the opportunity to properly graduate, once you complete a thesis!]]></story_4>
            <story_5><![CDATA[<b>Reached "Great Wizard" rank:</b>⮀ For once, your test-takers refrain from combusting, and you're told to wait outside while they discuss your performance. While you initially worry about being accused of cheating, when they call you back in they tell you quite the opposite: You have demonstrated the kind of mastery that would earn a student some special consideration! Instead of offering to enroll you, the college allows you to take your final tests right there and then, which you pass with flying colors!]]></story_5>
            <story_6><![CDATA[<b>Reached "Archwizard" rank:</b>⮀ You barely make it halfway through your routine before the world blurs around you, the walls of the office folding inside out as an immense room, looking much like a courthouse, takes shape around you. One of the black-robed people on the lower banks clears their throat. "Student! We of the Council have deemed you exceptional. Show to us your mastery, and join our ranks!" Once more, you actually struggle to impress your unexpected judges, but by the end you're offered the black robes of an Archwizard!]]></story_6>
            <story_7><![CDATA[<b>Reached "Great Sage" rank:</b>⮀ Even watching the little office melt away and the councilchamber of the Wizards' Council take its place loses some of its grandeur by now, and you definitely pick up on some whispering between the councilmembers. This time around, you are prepared and by the end of your demonstration, one of the Archwizards goes up in a blaze! ...She was quite embarrassed about it afterwards, but the council did grant you the title of Great Sage, along with the stone-grey robes of your new station.]]></story_7>
            <story_8><![CDATA[<b>Reached "Archsage" rank:</b>⮀ The members of the council are extremely experienced, gifted and difficult to impress, but your mastery of the Aether around you by now regularly sets off the entire lower banks of seats in a bonfire of approval. Rather than just a slightly whiter robe, you are now offered a deep red robe, along with a curled staff as you are promptly promoted to the coveted rank of Archsage!]]></story_8>
            <story_9><![CDATA[<b>Reached "Great Magus" rank:</b>⮀ While the early parts of your demonstration light the council ablaze, the Chair of the Council of Seven raises a hand. "Student. You stand here before us as an unknown, but you wield your might with a grace and dedication that even I am impressed by. How has an unknown like yourself managed to evade our scrutiny yet attain such immense prowess?" Odd wording of the question aside, you hurriedly come up with some not-technically-lies about you being a savant in the magical arts. While none of the high-ranking councilmembers buy it, you are still awarded the deep blue robes of a Great Magus. You suspect they gave you the rank to better keep an eye on you, frankly.]]></story_9>
            <story_10><![CDATA[<b>Reached "Archmagus" rank:</b>⮀ This time around, you don't even bother with the front door of the College, and instead perform the magical equivalent of knocking on the door of the Council's pocket dimension. Once you feel their approval for you to enter, you smoothly step in and give a polite bow to the council as every eye in the cavernous room is pointed at you. After a quick introduction, you point your finger at one of the Archmagi seated just below the Council of Seven and challenge him for his title, to the shock of everyone present! The duel itself is gruelling, as much for you as for your opponent, but by the end he yields to you. You can barely stand as he takes his vividly purple cloak off and drapes it over your shoulders.]]></story_10>
            <story_11><![CDATA[<b>Reached "Chair of the Council of the Seven" rank:</b>⮀ Time is precious this time, as you promptly step up to the council and challenge the Chair for the title. As is tradition for such a challenge, the other six members promptly rise and attack you together, but you endure the onslaught long enough to take them down one by one. While you are out of breath, the Chair gets up and calmly walks over to you, leaning in to whisper something in your ear: "Are you trying to take on the Seven?" You respond with only a nod, to which the Chair calmly takes off the bright white cloak with golden edges and puts it on your shoulders, the weight very nearly snapping your legs under you. "Then do not disappoint, and do not let the Seven wait," the former Chair says before walking out of the councilroom, leaving you to take the vacated seat of power.]]></story_11>

            <story_2><![CDATA[<b>50 Spatiomancy:</b>⮀ The first rule of Spatiomancy is that there's no such thing as "simple" Spatiomancy.

            <story_4><![CDATA[<b>600 Spatiomancy:</b>⮀ You just thought you were getting the hang of Spatiomancy when your teacher quite thoroughly blindsides you with the next level of complexity: Once you get a little better at Spatiomancy, you'll inevitably start figuring out ways to make spaces out of little corners and creases. And naturally, both literal and metaphorical corners and creases are subject to this. You toy with the idea of using Spatiomancy on your brain, and your teacher doesn't try to stop you.]]></story_4>
            <story_5><![CDATA[<b>1000 Spatiomancy:</b>⮀ Here is a fun fact: Shadows count as a metaphorical corner. While using your shadow as an extra pocket is nice and all, it also makes Spatiomancy a lot more tricky in the Shadow Realms since you have to work around a lot of extra Things it can latch on to; especially now that you're approaching a degree of mastery. Only one way forward remains: stubbornly marching ahead!]]></story_5>

Neptune, the God looking after the flying steeds, is a good sort and reassures you he'll take care of the paperwork after you've given him the modest fee for the administrative costs. As you walk to the middle of the meeting grounds, several of the flying equines swoop down low to get a better look at you. A tiny one with a mane in all colours of the rainbow hovers in front of you for a moment before shaking its head and zooming off, allowing a rich brown Pegasus touches down a few steps in front of you.

You recover quickly and bark out an order, earning you an eyeroll as the Valkyries take off and go the direction you indicated.]]></story_5>

            <story_9><![CDATA[<b>Attained rank "Lieutenant Commander":</b>⮀ The ranks are frankly starting to blend together in your head by now. Besides, you have better things to concern yourself with as you grapple with the shortest Frost Giant of all: Greip the Warchief. Fighting him on your mount would be an invitation for disaster, so (despite your mount's complaints) you're once again on the ground, one arm wrapped around the neck of the diminutive Frost Giant. He still towered twice as tall over you when he was standing, but you managed to trip him up. You just barely feel his heart grow still before your arms give out, and this time your stunt earns you a firm scolding from your higher-ups right after the awarding ceremony.]]></story_9>
            <story_10><![CDATA[<b>Attained rank "Captain":</b>⮀ The fight against the second-to-last Warchief, Hraesvelgr, is a grueling and drawn-out struggle made far worse by his tendency to draw energy from the corpses around him. And with how the fight is going, he's got a <i>lot</i> of reserves by the time you charge into him. Finally, by a concerted effort of you and several powerful Valkyries surrounding and charging him, you manage to cut his head off before he can draw in any more energy from the ongoing slaughter. The morale of the Frost Giants is visibly flagging by now, and if it wasn't for the final Warchief rallying them, you're certain they'd have broken rank long ago.]]></story_10>
            <story_11><![CDATA[<b>Attained rank "Vice Admiral":</b>⮀ The blood from Hraesvelgr hasn't had time to dry on your hands as you turn your attention to the final Warchief, the largest Frost Giant by a wide margin: Jörmungandr. The very air warps and sparks around his sword as he swings at you, screaming wordless vengeance for the scores of Frost Giants you slew. Your mount is pushed to his limits as you make him dodge and weave around the horrendously deadly blade, looking for an opening. Just as you feel your Pegasus about to faint from the exertion, Jörmungander overcommits to one attack, giving you a split second to jump down and throw your weight against the back of the blade and force it into his neck! The few remaining Frost Giants look in horror as the head of their leader falls before his own feet, before turning and running away while the Valkyries harrass the fleeing masses.]]></story_11>

            <story_6><![CDATA[<b>80% of warehouses robbed:</b>⮀ Scoping out the auction's warehouse confirms your suspicions. Dozens of guards, entrances that are under magical protection, even the lots themselves are bolted to the floor in several cases!

One of your crewmembers expresses his concerns that the trading company will be out for blood, but the Boss insists that it's all insured so they'll get their money. ...Insurance, huh? Wonder if you could get in on that racket as well...]]></story_7>

More specifically, the insurance company is immediately suspicious that someone who signed up with them three minutes ago immediately has damages to declare, and only your silver tongue keeps them off your back until the end of the loop.]]></story_1>
            <story_2><![CDATA[<b>10% of fraud committed:</b>⮀ Slowly but surely, you're getting a little smarter. This time around, your insurance agent gives you a suspicious glare before handing over the agreed-upon sum after you put on a sob story of how you were beaten up right in front of the office and had your watch stolen! If anything, it's a little scary how eager your fellow guildmembers are to knock your teeth out.]]></story_2>
            <story_3><![CDATA[<b>20% of fraud committed:</b>⮀ You had a realization during the planning phase of this loop's fraud: If the insurance company gets suspicious due to insured items suffering damage within a day, then the "obvious" solution is to do a little impersonation and cut with both sides of the knife. Your guildmates snatch the priceless artifacts, then you convince the insurers that yes, <i>you</i> are in fact the owner and should be compensated. Now just to get better at disguising yourself.]]></story_3>
            <story_4><![CDATA[<b>40% of fraud committed:</b>⮀ While stealing entire buildings is not quite an option, there is a lot of money to be made by 'informing' rivaling trading companies that the other group is working with the thieves that fleeced them last week, and that they won't get their stuff back because the Guard's been bought. Sure, none of them are exactly <i>happy</i> with it, but they're all to eager to pay you for the information once you sweeten the deal with the patrol schedules, and snatching up some insurance claims once the rival warehouse has burned down is a nice bonus too.]]></story_4>

The man in question has been put in a hairy situation by his insurance company, and is now discussing how to get revenge.

            <story_6><![CDATA[<b>75% of fraud committed:</b>⮀ You were in the process of concocting a scheme where you take out a life insurance on someone and then have them killed, when one of your guildmates bluntly tells you that she won't be helping you with something so "suicidally stupid." Pressing her for a bit, you learn that there is a certain "secret" guild in town that handles murder and assassination, who are none to eager to let some upstart start killing without paying their guild dues...]]></story_6>

This time however, you spot a folder you haven't seen before in the insurance company's director's office. It's a thin, black folder simply labled <i>in case of problems</i>.

Turning a corner, you get to see the entrance to the Guild for less than a second before someone's got a knife pressed to your throat and demands you explain how you found this place. Joining the Assassin's guild definitely is going to be your largest achievement in smooth-talking to date, but by the end of it all you walk out with a list of targets in hand, several lessons in how to keep a heart beating outside of its body and a still-hurting brand under your armpit.]]></story_1>

            <story_4><![CDATA[<b>Delivered four hearts in one loop:</b>⮀ You remember to give the guard the keyword this time around, and while you still get your guild-brand, at least the head assassin is impressed both by your uncanny ability to stay out of their notice <i>and</i> deal with some of their more far-flung targets.]]></story_4>
            <story_5><![CDATA[<b>Completed assassinations in all zones:</b>⮀ Having landed a hit on every target on your list, you briefly reflect on how little guilt you feel for the plentiful murders you have committed over the course of your "career" with the assassin's guild.

            <story_6><![CDATA[<b>Delivered eight hearts in one loop:</b>⮀ The head assassin takes a few moments to triple-check that the hearts are, in fact, the targets' hearts and not from some unfortunate schmucks left dead in an alleyway. Eventually, they get up and gesture to the side. Barely a word is exchanged the entire time, but shortly after you walk out of the hideout with a hefty sum of money and a <i>very</i> fancy wrist-mounted, automatically retracting and extending blade.

            <story_1><![CDATA[<b>Beheld the tower:</b>⮀ Carrying that last block of stone felt easier than any of the others, whether the combined attraction of the properly placed stones pulled it along or if the end being in sight gave you the motivation you needed. However, you barely get time to cheer as it slides into place and fills the final remaining gap before the blocks start rising up into the air, threads of light connecting them and interlinking until you are looking at a tower made of a hundred floating, glowing platforms. Already you can see the light of Valhalla shining at the very top while a set of blocks forms a staircase up to the first glowing floor. Also, there suddenly is a bunch of monsters between you and said stairs, better get busy and kill them fast!]]></story_1>
            <story_2><![CDATA[<b>Cleared 10 floors in one loop:</b>⮀ As you carve out yet another Fire Dragon's heart, you muse whether the gods are testing your "worth" or if they're just trying to avoid the consequences of their little wager this way.]]></story_2>
            <story_3><![CDATA[<b>Cleared 20 floors in one loop:</b>⮀ Fun fact about Chimerae: even with as many heads and pointy bits as they have, sliding under them and jabbing into their undersides deals with them quickly.]]></story_3>

            <story_5><![CDATA[<b>Cleared 40 floors in one loop:</b>⮀ The zombies seem out of place to you, their rotting flesh yielding quickly under your attacks. There aren't even enough of them to really slow you down.]]></story_5>
            <story_6><![CDATA[<b>Cleared 50 floors in one loop:</b>⮀ Minotaurs are annoying to fight in a place like this. Get too close to the center, they bull-rush you. Get closer to the edge, they slam you out of the tower with a haymaker. Dealing quickly with them keeps things bearable.]]></story_6>
            <story_7><![CDATA[<b>Cleared 60 floors in one loop:</b>⮀ The golems just make you feel sad somehow. Their design is a little too angular, a little too flawed to be the work of the gods. You wonder whose craftsmanship you're breaking on the way up.]]></story_7>
            <story_8><![CDATA[<b>Cleared 70 floors in one loop:</b>⮀ Panting for breath, you drag yourself past the latest bunch of gnomes. Sure, they don't hit hard, but there are enough of them to tire you out each time.]]></story_8>
            <story_9><![CDATA[<b>Cleared 80 floors in one loop:</b>⮀ After the gnomes' nonsense, fighting a cyclops is almost refreshing. Turns out they rely more on their ears than their eyes, so a little magic to play music distracts them immensely.]]></story_9>
            <story_10><![CDATA[<b>Cleared 90 floors in one loop:</b>⮀ With the top finally in sight, you pull out yet another one of the Centaurs' arrows from your knee. Fighting an enemy who can run <i>and</i> shoot at the same time is no fun whatsoever.]]></story_10>
            <story_11><![CDATA[<b>Cleared the entire tower:</b>⮀ Soaked in more blood than you ever wanted to see in one place and panting for breath in the thin air this high above the valley, you climb the final staircase to the highest floor of the glowing tower. The gods acknowlege you with a single solemn nod, before the first draws her weapons and closes in on you without a word. Showtime.]]></story_11>

            <story_1><![CDATA[<b>Challenge Athena:</b>⮀ Athena, protector of cities, approaches you with her shield held reolutely and unflinchingly. Your every blow bounces off of her defences and whenever you overcommit, she is quick to punish your agression with a swift shield-slam to the back of your head. Fighting her demands that you meet her carefully considered defences with your own intellect.]]></story_1>
            <story_2><![CDATA[<b>Defeat Athena with 500k Dexterity talent:</b>⮀ As the fight drags on, the rest of the Pantheon watching you and Athena exchange blows, you start to find ways around her imposing defences. A dance-like move here that just barely lets you get a light hit in to her side, a graceful dive over her shield there that buys you exactly enough time for a quick slap there... The fight is no less gruesome, but over time the light hits add up and eventually, Athena shakes her head and steps back, acknowledging her defeat.]]></story_2>
            <story_3><![CDATA[<b>Challenge Ares</b>⮀ Befitting a god of War and Courage, Ares announces himself with a wordless war-cry followed by him drawing a sword and shield, charging at you with all the ferocity of an entire army. You're barely left standing after that first charge and have to scramble to meet the next, kept on the back foot while Ares demands you fight him 'properly.']]></story_3>
            <story_4><![CDATA[<b>Defeat Ares with 500k Strength talent:</b>⮀ By the third charge, you've figured out much of what Ares is doing. You brace yourself while he turns for another charge, meeting him head-on and catching his shield with both hands. Ares barely has time to look surprised before you lift him off his feet and, with a scream rivalling his own, slam him down hard on the glowing floor while yanking the shield off of his arm. You prepare to punch him in the face, but he shakes his head and acknowledges his defeat, nudging you off of him with noticeable effort and returning to his seat as the next goddess takes to the field.]]></story_4>
            <story_5><![CDATA[<b>Challenge Demeter:</b>⮀ Watching the Goddess of the Harvest pull out a scythe as she approaches was something you more or less expected. Having her use such an impractical weapon with enough skill to nearly take your head off on the first swing is something you really should have seen coming, but sadly didn't.]]></story_5>
            <story_6><![CDATA[<b>Defeat Demeter with 500k Constitution talent:</b>⮀ The best way to handle a fight is to end it quickly, but Demeter is not giving you that chance. Her attacks are as relentless as an entire community trying to pull in a large harvest before bad weather can destroy the crops, and soon you're covered in gashes along your arms and back where her scythe slipped past your defences. In a desparate attempt to end this before you bleed out, you rush into one of her swings, gritting your teeth through the pain as the blade digs into your back while you keep the handle pinned with your arm as you slam Demeter in her face with your free hand. The shock is enough to make her lose her grip and back away, but before you can deliver a finishing blow, you hear something whistle through the air...]]></story_6>
            <story_7><![CDATA[<b>Dodged poison darts:</b>⮀ Still riding the adrenaline burst of your previous fight, you jump back as a flock of black feathers dig into the glowing floor, the acrid smoke rising from the very tips informing you that you really, <i>really</i> don't want to take more hits from these than necessary.]]></story_7>
            <story_8><![CDATA[<b>Evaded poison darts with 500k Speed talent:</b>⮀ At first, you just dodge and weave through the cloud of feathers zipping past you, but the longer it goes on, the more easily you can read the pattern. Still, you don't like the idea of just letting the gods harrass you like this, so you change tactics. Your hands dart out to the sides, catching several of the feathers between your fingers (giving you a split second to realize they're really metal knives with feather fletchings,) and throwing them back hard at the clouds from which they're being launched. There is a bit of commotion as a bunch of glowing figures squeal and run, causing Artemis to roll her eyes before elbowing Poseidon to get up.]]></story_8>
            <story_9><![CDATA[<b>Challenge Poseidon:</b>⮀ Fighting a guy with a trident is well within your abilities. Fighting one while getting shoved around by waves of seawater that follow in the wake of each strike is a hell of a lot harder, and keeping your balance long enough to not get kicked in the head by horses that weren't there five seconds ago isn't easy either.]]></story_9>
            <story_10><![CDATA[<b>Defeat Poseidon wiht 500k Perception talent:</b>⮀ It doesn't take long for you to start noticing how Poseidon works. If he sets up for a big swing while his trident is glowing, he's going to pull out a wave. If he sets up for a thrust, then you can bet on it that a horse is going to somehow pop out of his trident. Tracking his movements, you eventually manage to ride his waves into advantageous positions that let you get some good hits in while his back is turned! The fight ends when you dodge a thrust, using his trident as a springboard to land on the newly formed horse and have it deliver a double-hoof kick to Poseidon's face. The god of seas and horses looks quite grumpy as he wanders back to his seat, giving Artemis an 'all yours' nod while slumping down.]]></story_10>
            <story_11><![CDATA[<b>Challenge Artemis:</b>⮀ Artemis is, in a word, beautiful. You really don't get any time to appreciate that, though, as she promptly sends out a whole herd of shimmering deer that charge you horns first. The fight itself is another draining one; when she isn't having all sorts of forest critters gore you, she's keeping her distance and peppering you with more arrows than you think should fit in her quiver.]]></story_11>
            <story_12><![CDATA[<b>Defeat Artemis with 500k Charisma talent:</b>⮀ Charming the famously chaste goddess is a non-starter, but you quickly figure out that the shimmering herds she summons at you is really just a single herd getting called and dismissed over and over. Taming the wild animals takes quite a bit of effort, but with every cycle of Artemis summoning them to charge you between volleys of arrows, you get a little further. Soon enough, the herd starts deliberately parting ways to avoiding hitting you and a few of the deer even stop by you for a quick pat, much to Artemis' chagrin. Finally, you convice the largest member of the herd to let you mount them while turning to face Artemis, leaving her to scramble out of the way as her own herd turns against her. You barely get a second to enjoy the look of offence she's giving you before a red blur shoots past your face. "...Dang, was sure that one would hit," you hear Apollo complain as he takes to the field.]]></story_12>

            <story_13><![CDATA[<b>Challenge Apollo:</b>⮀ Apollo is- "Yeah yeah, I know I like to talk!" ...a chatterbox, which makes fighting him- "an utter delight, I'm sure. Anyway, before you ask: no, I do not know why I can make these balls, and frankly I don't really care," he explains while- "While making you look like the slow kid at PE," ...by repeatedly hitting you in the face with rough-textured red balls. "Dodge!"]]></story_13>
            <story_14><![CDATA[<b>Defeat Apollo with 500k Intelligence talent:</b>⮀ While the balls aren't nearly as painful as the last few gods' weapons, you soon learn that Apollo has a <i>very</i> good throwing arm. "Why thank you! It also helps that I know exactly where to hit you to make it hurt," he helpfully adds while giving you a playful wink. The longer the fight drags on, the more you feel like he's not taking it seriously at all as he effortlessly dodges anything you throw at him while repeatedly throwing balls at you. "That is because I don't!" he shouts while casually tossing a ball up and down, "this is all just a bit of good fun for me!" Thinking about it for a little longer, you drop your weapons and turn your back on Apollo as you sit down. "...Really now?" Apollo groans while lobbing his ball at the back of your head, "That's how you're going to try and beat me? By making this boring? ...Well, can't deny it's working. Spoilsport," he grumbles before taking his ball and presumably going home. Who knew! Sometimes, the only winning move is to not play!]]></story_14>
            <story_15><![CDATA[<b>Avoided lightning bolts:</b>⮀ One moment, you're trying to catch your breath after dealing with Apollo. The very next, you're screaming while light, sound and pain fill your senses, and you fall to your knees. Struggling to look up, you see Zeus pull back his arm and prepare another lightning bolt. Time to move!]]></story_15>
            <story_16><![CDATA[<b>Walked through the lightning with 500k Luck talent:</b>⮀ Try as you might, there is no rhyme or reason to the pattern of the bolts relentlessly striking down around you. Out of other options, you stand up straight and close your eyes, praying to... well, not the gods this time, that you make it through this time. You can still hear the lightning bolts striking down around you, can still feel the heat against your skin as you keep putting one foot in front of the other, the bolts coming faster with every step. Still, the only thing that stops you from going further is your foot bumping into the dais, the shock making you open your eyes and look up. Zeus is looking back at you, one eyebrow raised, before getting up to face you.]]></story_16>
            <story_17><![CDATA[<b>Challenge Zeus:</b>⮀ The King of the Gods looks at you for a moment, a lightning bolt crackling in his hand as he rises from his throne. You have no idea how, but the next moment your face is pressed down against the glowing floor from the sheer pressure Zeus exudes. You grit your teeth until you can feel your molars start to crack as you force yourself to your feet for this final fight.]]></story_17>
            <story_18><![CDATA[<b>Defeat Zeus with 500k Soul talent:</b>⮀ In the presence of the gods, mortals bow. Whether they want to or not, the sheer <i>weight</i> of the King of Gods' aura alone will make the strongest knees buckle. You, however, have faced this weight so many times through the loops that, while you can still feel it trying to force you down and prostrate yourself before him, you manage to hold your own. Zeus looks surprised for exactly one moment, and then your fist connects with his cheek. The longer the fight drags on, the less you feel the weight of his aura force you down, and the more Zeus himself seems to struggle to keep standing as the brawl drags out. Finally though, you manage to land a firm blow to the back of Zeus' knee, forcing him down into a kneeling pose. "...Enough," he says while rising to his feet. You brace for him to start using his bolts again, but instead he steps to the side and gives you a nod. The throne of the Gods, for you to claim.]]></story_18>

            <story_1><![CDATA[<b>Do it.</b>⮀ As you claim the powers of the gods and settle down on the throne, there is one moment of perfect stillness as the weight of your adventure finally settles down on you. You have seen more, done more in one day than most people do in a lifetime by a wide margin, but now it is over. Reaching out, you... no, I see the world through new eyes, and my hand gently reaches for the fraying thread of time, worn down by the many times my return to the start severed its many strands. Carefully, I weave my newfound power around one severed strand, making it grow into a full timeline in its own right, one in which I got into some trouble for running around Beginnersville looking for locks to pick. In another, I make friends with the Witch of the Forest Path. Yet another, I become a famous crafter, settling down in Merchanton after winning a large Architecture competition. Ages pass as I work, weaving the once single thread of fate into a richly coloured tapestry. And while fate has changed, time as a whole is whole, once more.]]></story_1>
