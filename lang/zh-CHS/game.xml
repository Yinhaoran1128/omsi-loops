                你滑倒了 - 摔坏了你的眼镜 - 而且包裹还摔开了, 一股奇怪的液体溅到了你身上.
                瞬间, 你微薄的法力开始迅速消耗. 就在你法力耗尽的时候, 你发现你回到了
                液体溅到你身上的瞬间, 你微薄的法力储备也充满了...虽然并没有比之前更多.
                循环不断重复, 世界似乎也随之不断重置, 直到你下定决心找出延长循环的办法.
                这个镇子似乎经常会把法力水晶存储到罐子里，也许你可以从那里开始...

                你到达了地牢的终点, 一个散发着柔和光芒的球悬浮在踏板上, 你找到了地牢的核心 - 至少是地牢第一层的.
                当你抓住它时, 它的精华注入了你的体内, 你似乎获得了它的力量. 虽然不多, 但这只是个小地牢. 
                你肯定还会再回来一遍, 那时又可以再摄取一次力量, 同时来自外域的知识也随之摄入, 这是永久保留的.

                你再次到达了地牢的终点, 但这次这个核心并没有散发光芒. 你最开始以为这个核心的能量来源于周围的魔力,
                但现在你发现你似乎以某种方式耗尽了它的精华. 这并不总是发生, 你只需要继续向世界释放魔力来为它充能.
                你只能耸耸肩, 接受了这个奇怪的设定, 继续你的循环.

          每级能力都会减少对应行动的法力消耗 1%.<br>
          天赋经验获取是能力经验的 1% , 并且循环不会重置它.<br>
          天赋可以给予能力经验 (1+(天赋等级)^0.4/3) 倍率加成.<br>
          一个行动能获得的经验是 (原始法力 / 当前法力) * (天赋加成) 每刻度.<br>
          总倍率等于天赋倍率乘灵魂石倍率.<br><br>
          举例：交朋友消耗800法力且属性比例为 <div class="bold">Int</div> 10% <div class="bold">Cha</div> 80% <div class="bold">Soul</div> 10%.<br>
          意思是其中80法力是 <div class="bold">Int</div>, 另外 80 是 <div class="bold">Soul</div>, 然后剩余的 640 是 <div class="bold">Cha</div>.<br>
          如果你的 <div class="bold">Cha</div> 在行动开始时等级为 20 , 加成就是 x1.2 也就是实际法力消耗为 640 / 1.2 = 533.33<br>
          再加上 <div class="bold">Soul</div> 和 <div class="bold">Int</div> 的 160 法力消耗, 总行动消耗 (向下取整) 应该是 694, 也就是 ~87% 的总消耗.<br>
          行动将提供 (800/694)*(1+(天赋)^0.4/3) 经验每法力总计 694 法力.]]></explanation>

            <story_2><![CDATA[<b>10% Witch knowledge learned:</b>⮀ The Witch as you taken to referring to her as, seeing as she changes her name every time she introduces herself to you, is a veritable font of magical knowledge, of how to dominate the mana itself and make more from less.]]></story_2>
            <story_3><![CDATA[<b>20% Witch knowledge learned:</b>⮀ You continue to hunt down the Witch and drag more information out of her, the magic she teaches you is cruel, callous even. The witch is surprisingly personable for what you would consider a stereotypical 'Wicked Witch'.]]></story_3>
            <story_4><![CDATA[<b>40% Witch knowledge learned:</b>⮀ You start to learn more about the witches daily routine as you spend more and more time around her, the relationship you manage to cultivate with her at the start of each loop grows more familiar with each repetition. She seems to be slightly more interested each time you reveal your knowledge of dark magic.]]></story_4>
            <story_5><![CDATA[<b>50% Witch knowledge learned:</b>⮀ You had apparently impressed her enough this time that she took you to a clearing she had found, and explained to you a ritual that would give you a boost, permanently through any circumstances by calling upon the dark gods. The catch she explained, with ill concealed glee, was that you would need souls to sacrifice if you wanted to do this ritual.]]></story_5>
            <story_6><![CDATA[<b>60% Witch knowledge learned:</b>⮀ As you learn more and more about the witch and her varied names, one thing starts to become glaringly obvious. The Witch and The Hermit know one another. If her irritable grumbling about the old fool and his idiotic desires were anything to go by. You get the feeling that their relationship is complex.]]></story_6>

You're all the more determined to pry it out of her though.]]></story_7>
            <story_8><![CDATA[<b>100% Witch knowledge learned:</b>⮀ Somehow she seems to sense something about you this loop, and she tells you her name, and its the name she gives for every loop after. Trisha. You manage to pry most of her relationship with the hermit from her. They were lovers once, this you knew, but what you didn't was that she was of nobility and he a common vagabond. She fell for him and him for her, it was a love for the ages she tells you while drunk from the wine you brought along with you. He wanted to run away with her and she agreed, too love struck to question why. He was running from deals he had made and bargains he had forsaken, his glib tounge landing him in trouble of the otherworldly nature. Trisha seems frustrated with her youth's naivety as she tells you how she was made a scapegoat for his failings and forfeits in his deals and bargains. How she was essentially sold to the dark gods as his forfeit. When you ask what she did in return, all Trisha does is smile with dark satisfaction, the fire flaring briefly.]]></story_8>

            <story_1><![CDATA[<b>3rd ritual segment reached:</b>⮀ Knowing what the ritual was and how large a space you would need, you were mildly surprised to find a clearing large enough in the forest. Well, the clearing itself wasn't really large enough on its own. It was a dense cluster of clearings that you've taken mana from that you could easily clear out to make a ritual space. Preparing the altar is surprisingly tame, all said and done. Stone and wood comprise most of the altar and the rest you brought with you when you made this plan. In the end the altar you build is only small, a communion point instead of a summoning. Holding a heart from nearby deer, you pierce it and begin to chant ritualistic words of power. The clearing grows dark and the forest quietens, nary a sound is heard apart from the drip drip drip of the blood from the pierced heart in your hand. The blood you've spilled on the altar begins to blacken and swirl without outside force and eventually forms into a small face, disgusting to look at but enough to communicate through.]]></story_1>

			<story_1><![CDATA[<b>1 Chronomancy:</b>⮀ Chronomancy is unlike any other magic you've practiced, and unbelievably finnicky. The mana has to be held perfectly still, as if time is at a standstill, and the slightest mistake will cause the entire spell to destabilize. It's hard work, but you finally get the hang of it and you feel yourself speed up by the barest fraction.]]></story_1>
			<story_2><![CDATA[<b>50 Chronomancy:</b>⮀ The effect is more pronounced now, and you find that your reflexes are keeping up with your increased speed. Unfortunately, though, the mana drain of the loops appears to have kept up as well, so even though you're getting the same amount of work done in less time you can't seem to get more work done in a loop.]]></story_2>
			<story_3><![CDATA[<b>100 Chronomancy:</b>⮀ You know that speeding up time isn't the only thing time magic can do, but it seems that for a human like you anything fancier is impossible without additional assistance. The runes recommend a group ritual but you're the only chronomancer you know, so instead you start learning what Tachytus has to say about chronomantic potions.]]></story_3>

			<story_1><![CDATA[<b>1 Pyromancy:</b>⮀ Pyromancy is more normal than chronomancy, but it makes up for it by being extra dangerous.
